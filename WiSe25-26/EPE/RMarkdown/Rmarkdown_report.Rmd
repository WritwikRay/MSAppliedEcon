# Introduction to R Markdown: Writing a paper or report

This is crude example. For further details, first check the associate documents:

- Rmd_resources.Rmd;

- RMarkdown_slides.Rmd; 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Project: Fuel Demand

We will work with part of the fuel data used in Huse (2018), which estimates the demand for gasoline ($g$) and ethanol ($e$) in the Swedish market. Our aim is to estimate demand equations of the following form:

$$ln(q_{et}) = \alpha_{1e} + \sum_{k=e,g} \gamma_{ek} ln(p_{kt}) + \theta_e Z_{et} + \varepsilon_{t}^e$$

$$ln(q_{gt}) = \alpha_{1g} + \sum_{k=e,g} \gamma_{gk} ln(p_{kt}) + \theta_g Z_{gt} + \varepsilon_{t}^g$$

Here, $t$ denotes months, $q_{ft}$ the sales of fuel $f=e,g$ at period $t$, $p_{ft}$ the price of fuel $f$ at period $t$, $Z_{ft}$ are demographics, controls, and fixed-effects, $\varepsilon_{ft}$ are error terms


# OLS 

The basic command for regression models is **lm()**. The optional argument data exists because several data.frame's can co-exist in R.

```{r, eval=F}
lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + ..., data = df)

```

The traditional way to extract regression output is via **summary()**, but nicer versions are also available

```{r, eval=F}
ols1 <- lm(y ~ x, data=df)
summary(ols1)

library(broom)
tidy(ols1, conf.int = TRUE)
glance(ols1)

```
